So I have to wonder, If I were to have payed full price and not purchased it via groupon, would I still have been shorted time? Either way I find it a poor business practice to offer a massage of any length and not give the full time stated.

This place nickels and dimes you for E V E R Y T H I N G! It would be one thing if they were doing this and billing insurance, but nope it's all out of pocket! I called ahead of time to get a price estimate for hormones which they did but they were off by hundreds of dollars! You can't get out of there without them charging you for something.

My friend's physio therapist has definitely helped him regain his knee strength, but unless you have insurance coverage, the price for physio in my opinion, is too damn high!!

I still don't understand how their paperwork process works, but essentially they offer physicals and prescriptions, and the cost for your birth control is the lowest available - though the price isn't covered by insurance because they aren't actually a pharmacy.

 My concern is that she sells a package to people that is extremely overpriced when you actually price out the components.
