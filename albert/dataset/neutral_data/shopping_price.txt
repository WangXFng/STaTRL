They then slash the prices considerably and sell them for a price that is often still too high in my opinion.

In all three times the staff was super nice and helpful, willing to explain about each product and even match prices (only if they have it in stock) Regarding that, I actually came in hoping to leave with a stroller but the salesperson told me that the ad that we found online has a newer stroller than they one they carry, so she could not match up the price for me.

Their price matching policy is a bit deceptive in that they only price match Amazon and Barnes and Noble (maybe some other big retailers too that I've forgotten about) but not only do you have to get it off those marketplaces but the order has to be fulfilled by Amazon or Barnes and Noble themselves and not a third party even if the book is new.

It just sometimes takes a while to find what I am looking for and often the most time consuming part is searching throughout the store trying to locate the best price of the title being offered since the price often varies and that variance is not dependent upon book condition .

My biggest complaint is where they apply their price tags...Instead of using seams or tags, they pop right through the meat of the product in a noticeable spot, lessening, and sometimes ruining the value of it! I especially hate when they do this to vintage pieces.
