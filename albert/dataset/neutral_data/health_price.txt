Also, the price doesn't include lenses and I'm not sure how much that costs, my lenses are pretty basic, no astigmatism or anything.....so I'm not sure how it ended up costing so much but in the end, I was sick of being there and just wanted to leave with a decision.

If you buy a package of 3 at Transformations (to be used whenever you want, including over the course of 3 years), the price is less than $1000, making it on par with Robertson.
