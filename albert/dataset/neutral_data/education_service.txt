Once inside, to receive any service, just queue up like cattle before reaching the service counter.

For example, most vendors or service providers would see the \"Statement of Work\" as the birth certificate of a project rather than the \"Project Charter\".

The interesting thing is the school didn't call their client to ask about the instructor's performance after each lesson which means they don't have any procedure to assure their service quality.

I started this draft in August on the date of service and just picked back up so I'll let my point wrap with this: the teacher was out of pocket when it comes to chemicals like a relaxer that never EVER stop processing just roll with a direct answer and move on.

 How does the owner offer to replace the defective part for me and then change their mind once it is time to replace it?  Stay away from this place if you want any kind of good service after the sale.
