Upon calling the Enterprise's customer service, they would exchange the Ford Flex with a Dodge Caravan as we desired rather than wait on Enterprise's abysmal roadside service program to replace the front right tire.

There's a 'members' lounge' (you qualify if you are a Starwoods Preferred Guest member) on the 8th floor that serves up continental breakfast in the morning and hors d'oeuvres in the evening - free for 'members' and still cheaper than the room service menu even if you're not a registered 'member' ($12 for breakfast, $9 for hors d'oeuvres).

If you do want to skip a day and hang out on your own be mindful that they will make you sign paperwork and at their discretion, they can \"cancel the remainder of your trip or potentially NOT provide shuttle service back to the airport.\" At least that's what they told several members of our group that wanted to do their own thing.

When 63 fails - it fails miserably: no buses for 30 minutes (on a frequent service line), buses bunching up 3+ at a time (resulting in large gaps in service), buses too full to get on, etc.
