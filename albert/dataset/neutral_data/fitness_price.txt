The staff is friendly enough, and seeing as how its the closest 24 hour fitness place in this neighborhood, i suppose they get away with the price :)

I wanted to give this place 4 stars but the price of the gym alarmed me.

As for the price - it's the exact same if you sign up for a year, but you can cancel without a fee if you move more than 20 miles away.

I was there just asking the price, tour the facilities and get some information and they make you talk to one of their counsellor and you have to tell them your \"life history\" in order to able to get the different price structure..

I'm a workout fanatic, but I'll tell you what, this place isn't bad for the price the only downfall is that it's not that big, but it's really clean and quiet and you can workout without any hassle of bumping into people, etc.

You can get \"black card\" membership which is $9.99 which gives you access to all location, half price drinks, free to use facilities like massage chairs tanning bed etc.

However, for the price it is a fantastic deal and a great membership to have.

 There's a 30 day free trial offer but I ended up not going through with it because it affected the price of the packages if you wanted to get them after.

 Second of all, the classes are 45 minutes including the cool down which is ideal for boss bitches trying to get things done, and lastly they have wicked deals! I got an intro price of $60 for two unlimited weeks.

 Same price with a much better selection of machines, free weights, and dumbbells.

 Trainer Jo was unwilling to give me a price quote upfront and was rude and pushy.

  Although my sister pays the same price and the competitors gym she goes to is much nicer and cleaner.

  You're better off doing Mountainside and attending their free classes for a quarter of the price or Cross Fit is only about 129 per month unlimited.

 Unlike the previous reviewer, I found the price structure to be clear and consistent.

 It is based on how many months you want to commit and how many sessions per week you want to attend, I believe the price is comparable to other Crossfit gyms, and is reasonable for what you are getting, which is basically small group personal training.

 All I wanted was a place to get out of the heat and lift and do some cardio which for this price why not.

 But the price includes a hand towel, filtered water, a block, and that high-quality mat cleaner spray.

The catalog of services offered for the price makes it the best fitness in Canada.

 They offered a reasonable price to start their \"On-Ramp\" class so I decided to finally give it a shot.

 Came back to shop to pick up my tanks and ask them about the price difference, staff said \"they have to charge more because the tank was freshly hydroed and their responsible for whatever happens to the tank\".

  Endless sparkling wine, snack trays, tea, coffee, and other beverages are included in the price - not so at Mario's.

 You can't put a price on that.
review_id : MGwOLA0Eyjw6-RbEeb8ApQ
  And if you sign up for a package of sessions (and\/or prepay in advance), they're willing to scale the price to bring the total cost down.

 The price options vary depending on your commitment length and class attendance, saving more if you're okay with a longer commitment or if you want less days.

While Birkdale may offer some of the best faciilities, for me, the price and annoying nature of the employees at the management level cancels it out.
review_id : Wh5CpqxnataMBOxo5rpXBw
If price is a concern, there are definitely better options in the area.

 All in all, neither of us was impressed enough to say we would join this club, even though the price is very competitive.

I showed her the black card and very rudely she said \"what are you doing? What are we doing?\" so I explained to her I have the black card and always get the half price drinks..but she went on about how she's going to refuse the discount because my boyfriend was paying and made me go get my card which was an annoying and petty inconvenience.

I used to be a crunch member and I pay the same price with everything.

They have family plans that you can add under the main account for a cheaper price for a fee ($25).

A few critiques are that the price for a drop in class seems high ($15), also I didn't know it was going to be a hot class before i started and would have dressed differently had I known.

It's $15 for a walk-in class and the price is lowered to $10 or less per class if you buy 4+ class packages.

The gym also has a big back room which they sometimes offer classes at a descent price or free.

The Oxford isn't nearly as busy as LA Fitness, though, and while it does have the feel of a more \"privileged\" clientele that could turn some people off, the exclusivity might be one of the reasons that it's easier to actually get on the equipment that you want to use...but is the price for that convenience worth it? That's up to you to decide.

The instructors are great, and the membership price is unbeatable at 55\/mo for unlimited classes.

 But $15 for a guest pass?  Who charges for guest passes anymore?  Charge the damn hotel guests that price but not friends of members.

the truth is most people do not pay the same price at all.

Checking the price point of unlimited classes, I'm thinking I'd be a tad hesitant to enroll, if only because the gym only offers classes, no free weights or drop-in extras.

There isn't anything at Pure Fitness that you can't find at another gym for half the price this gym is charging.

This is primarily because the classes are so overbooked! Even when a class isn't marked as \"pole share\" on the schedule, you can almost guarantee that you will have to share a pole with someone, meaning that you pay full price but only get half the work-out! When a class IS marked as pole share (e.g.

If you only need a single club access, the price point is quite reasonable (less than $75\/month) and offers a decent workout in a pretty well kept environment.

I pay the price for the convenience of having a gym so close to my condo.

I would probably say that is the price you have to pay to concentrate in a gym because its quite empty (private gym).

 The price for a membership is competitive as well.

Honestly, for what Fit4Less offers, I don't think their price or gym quality is bad at all despite it's current rating...
