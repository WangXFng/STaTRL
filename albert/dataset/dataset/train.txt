Maybe it's not fair for me to rate 1 star if I didn't receive their services but based on the quality of customer care before even making it into their salon I feel it's valid.	Service	60

The service was fast but horrible.	Service	60
Helen is the worst manager, the worst person, the worst customer service I have ever had to deal with.	Service	60

Anyway, I won't be returning here and I suggest if you're in the market for a high price salon you look elsewhere as the price does not reflect the quality given.	Price	61
I am well aware of the average price of getting your hair done these days, but believe this salon needs to educate this stylist a lot more before allowing her to be on the floor by herself and charge such a high price for the talent I left with on my head.	Price	61
When i expressed my issue, they told me to save my certificate and pay for the appt - it cost me $80.00 for a disgusting nail job and bad serice.	Service	60
