Great service station that knows what they are doing but try to sell you things and then note it on your service record in your account for the next time, whenever you decline.
review_id : eGkimbUybDGoZ_UWWrKz6w
Some of the service was done by them only months prior, and they acted as if they couldn't find it within their computers.
review_id : eGkimbUybDGoZ_UWWrKz6w
Shouldn't be that hard, if whenever I decline their service that they offer me besides the oil change, they remind me the next time that I declined them the last time.

I took then keys back to the service manager and he said okay I will be right back.

This finally happened and the service manger brought me my car to my office for me which was very nice but because I was at work I didn't get chance to inspect the work until I got home late from work that day.

The service was not express (by my definition), and, in this case, we were left hanging by the service department.

On more than 1 occasion, when I've brought my car in for a service they have \"accidentally\" charged me again for a service I already paid for.

 For example, the vehicle owner drives their vehicle into the stall and waits inside the vehicle while service is done.

It is currently going under some renovations, expanding on the sales show floor, and I think the service bay area.

They have three main service advisors, a male and two females.

When you drive up to the service bay door, they usually have you inside within about 5-10 minutes.

When I picked it up, the service manager asked why we were having it towed and then told my husband it was the air valve that wasn't on right and that the stalling issue was fixed.

However, I can't say the same about the service team just for the simple fact that it usually takes an incredibly long time.

Smart's customer service just called my husband and offered a refund for the inspection I discuss below, so I have changed my ratng from a 1 to a 3.
review_id : DP6Dbo9rjrdIQPTMkn1Jjw
I had emailed Smart last night with my complaint, and my husband went in and talked to the service department this morning, with no results so I don't know what triggered the call now but I am happy that it did--perhaps someone finally read the email that I sent last night.
review_id : DP6Dbo9rjrdIQPTMkn1Jjw
 When I dropped the car off, I told the service person that I wanted an oil change and nothing else and that my husband had just changed the air filter, the cabin filter and rotated the tires.
review_id : DP6Dbo9rjrdIQPTMkn1Jjw
 My car has only 30,000 miles on it and there is no need to inspect it for the things that are included in their all points inspection (expecially when they knew that I would not need an air filter change, cabin filter change or the tires roated) so they were, in my opinion,  selling me an unnecessary service and not clearly presenting it as an extra charge service.

There is a self service machine in each that you drive up to, and you read the instructions carefully, it is fully touch control.
review_id : hjhkkXOhOp0T_6KCNBiG9Q
Their self service machine does give you change if you happen to have a $5.00 bill for the $3.00 wash or you are one to have your car super clean.
review_id : hjhkkXOhOp0T_6KCNBiG9Q
Before I forget there are employees around to help guide your car through the wash or if you somehow happen to have problems with the self service machine.

Wait...so do they really think KEEPING A CAR for a DAY AND A HALF (or MORE) is a reasonable length of time in order TO CHANGE THE OIL?  Especially when the service was confirmed the day before?  Or have their customer service standards gotten so low they can't be bothered to be upfront and honest about how long it would take to fit someone in?
