  Menu items are a bit all over the place, so that may be the driver of the wide variance in food quality.

The food was nothing special-- but not bad.
review_id : SFzGdbauVhUIhvx3pFp3Ow
Trying to get a beer is an Olympic event and the food will come out right around the time you've put on your coat and decided you've had enough.

Understandable no outside food is allowed in the room! There's a wide selection of beers and their comped drinks are just as strong as the charged drinks! Top notch bar foods were delivered to my seat from Five50, personally I love their pizzas, GARLIC BREAD, and wings!

You will probably end up leaving smelling like fried food as it's all right behind the bar

 It's unpleasant trying to enjoy food when you see hairy arses peeking out from loose jeans.

Menus and food came quickly.
review_id : OezBlxhn2YuuNb3mcOsSaw
 I did not try any of the food and only stayed about an hour but nothing really made it seem worth going back to again.

 The food is only average.
review_id : xwqnWQWNs00NVRO4VnIHEQ
 The food special they had ran out by 5:30pm!  Right in the middle of dinner hour.
review_id : fcN1wtATHpuD-XhYtY1CSw
I've only been here for food on the terrasse so I can't judge the inside.
review_id : H6oRgD_Sbgnt5DPsWIhvMw
This is not the place I'd order food from, they are really not even equipped for that.
review_id : n6qav4tUe2dbgl9VdzRCBw
They stopped serving many food products.

Rabbit food category covers salads.

The bartender has to sling drinks and food to the entire place so service is extremely slooooowww.........
review_id : ZYrIVL87X_yCPdhEnavUwQ
There was no food left so I decided to try some cocktails.
review_id : t8hrPoqQXPTpx2rfTqBWKQ
We then waited over 40 minutes for the food to be placed and multiple things were forgotten.
review_id : PPEfsvvYaBOcGMzY1t3y_A
 Did not try their food at this point, but their kitchen was closed anyways.
review_id : 4uDdliizVxyrOmSzuTpGUA
The food took a long time to come.
review_id : fd6xfZ88z8m-kMU93wQ91g
The reason for the 3 stars is because of the food quality.
review_id : B5ddYvSILWD2laTbKsZK6A
Our only complaint was that it took a while for our food to come.
review_id : KDNihLZAkBhyuCg65AJA8A
I didn't get a chance to try the food so I can't comment there.
review_id : hwGcTPrZEndKTdYxRZdquw
This is strictly a pub with no food or machine snacks but the music is great, absolutely great.
review_id : BoyikBiL2OjxU3SV_0-vTQ
Sadly, when I wanted to order food the menu was unavailable.
review_id : Jqzc6DJDZXbfCFp_o40iHA
Our server was right at our table when we arrived, got our drinks to us promptly, took our food order in a timely fashion, and got refills at just the right time.

I haven't tried the food personally, but the pool tables are nice and fun.
review_id : RQ66uhpcInOKmOXrJ2XU2g
 We didn't order food but we bellied up to the bar and asked for two (2) long islands.
review_id : cTtivUawaZXLftjG1okmVA
The food and beverage department used to run the Gold Lounge but mismanaged it.
review_id : CbAhsqIKwb4IaJL16fGYcA
 Just the feeling I got...maybe it was sticking to the table before the food even came - who knows! 
review_id : 7b8ZuIaLrwFjOzs2fOyZWg
  We notice another table seem a little bit upset that they had been waiting for their food for a long time.
review_id : iUJttw6sBXfgEWUOR9ddgg
 They serve food during the day but I always show up when they're done serving food.
review_id : p_Hb81JLMYieFkE8N7NyoA
I should point out they do not serve any food inside, but they will allow you to bring food in.
review_id : FmxNYTQB_nGG3j8DKKtIsg
 They serve pasta, French Canadian food and American fare all on the same menu.
review_id : mRk3QBuHO5YE79NrvaI7MA
In our clicking-so-well haste, we opted to drive until we found a dive bar, and go in for food and drinks.
review_id : udaddz_Vy1qGgeCC7_1goA
All food is $5.99.

Knowing my dad's tastes, I figured we could get some decent bar food here.
review_id : wbxwA66xq0aoqNjMKI9-aQ
The food came out in a reasonable amount of time.

The food at Spectators is typical of a sports bar.
review_id : pSpntNwXDwBszp-lIhKTzQ
I liked that they had a small food menu which made it easy to choose from.
review_id : MDWkqovYpbjL6C6-JSSPZQ
While they don't quite stand out amongst other chains, they are consistent and have some unique food offerings...
review_id : L6sf2GMivLzqKSd-iRSSMw
Went looking for Thai food and found this place instead...LOL

The waitress came around and took my order and the food was out within a couple of minutes.

The bar is still open but they stopped serving food in August.
review_id : -Yb639fmMm58dDhDvnUscw
 But most of the time they don't mind if you have food delivered.
review_id : gko2HHRWbjmncBFvEq8PAA
And they should have food available....venders or food trucks or something.
review_id : hdEGVhe9565_gwLGYe3psw
Most food booths are cash only and they don't serve drinks.
review_id : x8rQsMvmBL73KuGAuCnhrQ
The food prep execution lacked and was very slow to leave the kitchen.
review_id : tA5xyckXmdBNnw95RuN6rw
The food is the same and the beer is the same.
review_id : cBHki3IgOwqKmRlttsNy3Q
It is what it is- a fast food restaurant.
review_id : lZtOWrX4Fx-TI7KICsE4LQ
The only place serving food and drinks after 11pm on a Sunday night.
review_id : JkRc-lgS6vXWUdVk5U4P_w
 The same vendors and festival food are there as there is at something like Matthews Alive or even Speed Street.
review_id : r7z5xrBHe1tPcN3zMgXOew
Didn't get our food for 50mins.
review_id : doLm1P-mSvy6wygNOUhCMw
 I know the food service has changed here, therefore so has the menu.
review_id : FZ-ZpLHT_w3BU78fhcM5dA
The owner's a nice guy who interacts with his patrons and the food is good for pub fare.
review_id : jXY5Ca14-XPaTmstYKAIaw
don't get food there.
review_id : gJecrS7yFuMw27pkc0kQFA
 Sometimes, there were staff from the kitchen that had to bring out food because there were just no waitresses to be found.
review_id : na7p_j1ntssMGXiAt2A2hw
 The food that I have tried is pretty typical bar food.
review_id : G4nw8KqLeLrA-vsLXmznsw
I happened to stumble upon Arbar on Yelp when I was searching for food options in the area.
review_id : cAP65muXWhsz3vfGun8MQw
It looks like recently the owner or at least name changed slightly but the food on the menu seems to be the same.
review_id : SFbN7Y_TO2z14UfSenZQSQ
 We waited for our food for over 30 minutes and then they messed up our order.
review_id : F-ZsmYjNyMj1k0ir7XQzXA
I have not tried their food yet, but will most certainly do it the next time I go there!
review_id : _S1wD4_yKJhp21DhnJ4pHg
The variety of food is off the charts, a lot of options, however I'd like to point out the lack of vegan options.
review_id : AWbxLPHxRo-2wpGLgbM9WQ
We have been for breakfast, lunch and dinner and the food is mediocre.
review_id : dUyGLn-3IiNBebWtSQ-I_A
We had to wait super long for our food to come out..
review_id : pC2hYe51wEJboIEbESc4uw
My advice is to have your drink and food order ready at the same time.
review_id : g6lVCpC2S5uYiErpanuMSA
I assume it's there seasonal hour, so we decided to get some food as well.
review_id : ixJNvImkiRvXcyuVtLeOQw
 Lack of an established kitchen means no standing menu, but I hear they are working on getting food delivered or in-house.
review_id : YBGHFmrXz1X2QrwwjVu6CQ
Haven't tries the food yet but i'll review it when I do.
review_id : ZK1YB_8XfAYjFzb36TBkkw
They have a food menu of mostly pub food.

The food is nothing out of the ordinary, typical bar fare like pizza, wings, burgers, etc.
review_id : zUyEGF3tHJyZGDC_kr8-yg
 Also it was one of the only places in the area serving food after 11 on a Wednesday.

Good if you want to catch a game and grab some simple food and drinks while you watch it.
review_id : 2uF3_uL7G1eHwAt-np3_CQ
So would check out again and try the food
review_id : SwcrMAyc5xObHCkUkfHoMg
I didn't try any food and didn't see anyone else eating a meal so can't comment on the food.

They advertise food until 2am which is probably the best thing about The Graduate.

The food came out fast even though they were very busy and the wings were ok.
review_id : pK1_yubWMJQseaQ0PNExOA
 And to even have a bar with food specials on Saturday must prove the stereotype that Canadians are just nicer.
review_id : citOvoO_qQ_1spTBkmLyMQ
Sadly to say we tried to only come for the food after reading a BlogTO post on the opening of the fried chicken popup Five Points that is inside Open House.
