I think they should include a bath in the price as I had seen some other kennels advertise because they smelled very bad when I picked them up, which is typical when boarding.

*re: scenario above, I told them I didn't want a knockoff, I wanted the real Furminator, and they told me the price turned people off, and they preferred the 'like' item instead.

(And I suspect that the owners would be furious if they knew this.) However, there are charges where nothing can be done, like the price for urinalysis for the external lab, or prescriptions.

It was clean, the staff was friendly, and our puppy was so happy and tired out from playing when we picked him up - he slept like an angel that night! The only reason I wouldn't give Chasin' Tails 5 stars is because we also had our puppy groomed while he was there and it wasn't very well done - but the price for grooming is very reasonable! I will definitely be taking our dog back in the future!

This really took a hit economically for us and when we finally found out what my dog had (a very easily treated condition common in his breed) we couldn't believe that we spent 1000$ and the vet couldn't tell us that! The vet also recommended Hills science diet dog food which we switched to for a hefty price and later found out was full of grain and my dog's breed would be prone to yeast infections if he continue eating it.

I have not heard of the other doctors which they mentioned but I am sure that they exist as doctors frequently have products named after them but I would expect to find their products available either through retail outlets or other veterinarians rather than being sold at a premium price exclusively from the vet himself.
