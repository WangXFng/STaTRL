Not to mention it's so expensive, the pottery pieces are priced really high and you also have to pay a sitting fee.	1	0
This store is full of high end stuff that is way over priced, the storefront is totally pointless because the instrument dealers sells most of his stuff on Ebay.	1	0
 The pottery is extremely over-priced and they will sneak in an aditional sitting fee for the adult who helps a child paint even a small section of their piece.	1	0

 There are food stands everywhere selling extremely expensive morsels because they know that you already spent $10 to get in and why would you get food outside of the event.	1	0
 The tickets were a gift from family and It extremely upset that they paid a high price for them to see this very outdated and low energy show.	1	0
 Absolutely the worst service I have received in a very long while.	2	0
The reviews were not awesome but they also were all based on experiences actually visiting the restaurant (slow service, that sort of thing).	2	0

Very poor customer service.	2	0
Where do I start? Well me and 3 other friends all left this gym after a month or two because the gym was overpriced for what it provided, it was also mildly creepy and every time I walked in there I felt like I was walking onto a B horror film set.	1	0
The worst customer service of any gym I've ever been to.	2	0
Most importantly, the ice cream was bland and overpriced.	1	0
I've seen many loyal paying members leave this gym over the years because of him and his lack of basic customer service.	2	0
Bad bad service like omg.	2	0
It looks like they went and bought fry's pumpkins and over priced them to make money.	1	0
 Every time we really start liking one location, they bring in new employees who either never learned about customer service or just don't care.	2	0
I haven't experienced customer service this bad in quite awhile.	2	0

Who failed at teaching a single PCT class is leading the students into a waste of time and money!	1	0
 Yes it is expensive, but the worst part is the chaotic class schedules and there is absolutely no value in the money you are spending.	1	0
Not worth the money.	1	0
you are wasting your time and money.	1	0
Overall Delta West Academy is an appalling excuse for a private academy with a lack of teachers who understand the students and an extremely high price for an extremely low quality education.	1	0
A complete waste of time and money.	1	0
Instead, I wasted my money and my time with them.	1	0

I went in to get a mani\/pedi and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of service.	2	1
Firstly, amazing customer service everyone there seems very friendly, inviting and nice.	2	1
Everyone once in a while you'll get a scalp massage from a hairdresser, and sometimes there's a TV on somewhere, but at MVP Modern Barbers there's also a complimentary drink (I assume coffee or cola) and a hot towel and straight razors and great service.	2	1
For a great haircut at a decent price, and great priced hair products, I would definitely recommend Green Apple.	1	1

However, customer service was never great.	2	0
I agree with previous reviews, poor  customer service for sure.	2	0
BAD customer service, Margarita the owner was not helpful to my needs!	2	0
Bad customer service and unreliable staff to be honest.	2	0
Not the experience I wish I had to write about, but have to make potential customers aware of the terrible customer service and to make sure they select the right barber here.	2	0

Terrible customer service.	2	0
She was just completely rude and it was terrible customer service.	2	0
Maybe it's not fair for me to rate 1 star if I didn't receive their services but based on the quality of customer care before even making it into their salon I feel it's valid.	2	0
My low rating is mainly for the threat of the $35 fee, lack of technology, long wait times and the customer service experience.	2	0
The service was fast but horrible.	2	0
Helen is the worst manager, the worst person, the worst customer service I have ever had to deal with.	2	0

The quality of service is very hit or miss too.	2	0
I paid for the services but definitely didn't leave a tip.	2	0
The owner is not friendly and lacks customer service.	2	0
The lack of customer service and professionalism is probably one of the reasons why no one wants to work there and is why people who did work there left.	2	0
In my opinion that is a lack of customer service.	2	0
If I am paying for a service you provide great customer service as well.	2	0
Without customer service and personality you will be dry like your lips are.	2	0
I can't understand how a business fails at customer service so much!!	2	0
