 Long dinner, short, neither the meal nor the service disappointed.

Wasn't here on a regular night, so I can't say how the service is normally.

 Also because we entered in through the Banker Hall mall entrance, we didn't get service until we hunted someone down.

Upon arriving we had to wait in line as the regular bottle service guy was not there, he had an emergency and had to backout, so we waited about 15min for the replacement who was polite and professional with us

 This weekend, June 2012, we did dinner at Diablos, bottle service at Gold Lounge, then free entrance and drink tickets at Haze.

Had more fun using Light Group for a table at Gold Lounge on Friday night with Light Group than I did waiting in the 2 hour line for our table service at Marquee the next night.

We had a party of 20 so service was, well we only had one server it wasn't the fastest, I've had slower plus we were the only ones in the restaurant.

Seriously this is a down to earth pub, clean, good service with plenty of room to relax with a friend, and cold beer on tap.

 Additionally, there was no beverage service on the slot machines.

 While we thought that this place might be decent when we first walked in, BOY WERE WE WRONG! No service for 18 minutes and there were LITERALLY 3 people at the bar.

Parking:  The first thing that stands out in my mind is that we could find parking!  I did not see any Valet service offered which is good and bad.

  Bottle service was offer to those who can afford it on the right in big Red lounge chairs.

 Angelina's, the connecting restaurant, offers their menu and full service bar side.

 Cleats (Happy Moose) will survive without us, but this is no way to run a service based business.

  At the bar, service is pretty typical for a club-kind of slow.

  The place was great, but when there was confusion about our bottle service (we had pre-paid two bottles) Oren came right over personally himself, and sorted out the issue for us.

   Bottle service is very popular here, it seems you are not allowed to sit on the couches unless you buy bottle service.

Under the three star category I would list the service and the hours.

 I imagine this will work itself out, it's not really fair to judge service too harshly on a place that is open for its first weekend.

 If you are in the service industry your tips come from your attentiveness and happy demeanor.

 Hands down the worst bartending service I've had in my life anywhere.

 Customer service tells me yet again \"sorry there is nothing we can do\".

 On top of that, for a group of 14, they got us table service in a location smaller than a coffee table while smaller groups have twice the size of our space.

 Cheap bottle service on the indoor\/outdoor balcony made the night come alive.

 Bottle service is $240 PER BOTTLE.

 I work in the service industry so I get it if it takes longer than normal to get a drink\/food at a place when it's busy.

 They have bottle service and allow food to be brought in.

 Their service fluctuates a lot, which cost a star.

Why do service levels drop like a stone the minute the Stampede starts? Its is like someone rings a bell.

We recently heard that during day service leashed dogs are allowed on the patio, we will try that next, as we love to enjoy as an entire family.

 The bottle service girls looked miserable and unenthusiastic.

 If I knew Charli- sucked at service I would have stayed here for the entire night!

 and then another while later they come back and take our food order, I wish I read the reviews first before trying this place out cause the service was very slow.

 We had bottle service reserved, and the whole group was supposed to be comped if we arrived before 11, but due to circumstances beyond our control we arrived late, and in separate groups.

 I mean, most of them were actively looking away from me, so I couldn't even flag one down unless I called out to them (which is ridiculous--why should I have to do that to get service in a restaurant).

  When I wanted breakfast and didn't feel like going outside the hotel and also didn't want to pay the higher room service fees, that's where H2 EAU came into the picture.

 A lot of stalls and sinks, but some were out of service they also have a few seats and a back drop with bar code written all over it so you can take all the pictures you want, lol

 On weeknights the service is a little slower as it is the bartender that also serves as a waiter, and the place is never empty enough to get constant attention.

 While we are figuring all this out the promoters and bouncers are trying to do 5 things at once,letting groups of people in before us and before all the other people who paid for bottle service and are waiting patiently behind us.

I don't have too much to say about the service because it was decent on the day we were there.

While I totally understand the appeal of this place, as the view speaks for itself and the lavish ambience and exclusive entrance up the elevator seems like a pregame night in heaven, as I say and all of my reviews, I don't care how upscale the place looks - if I don't get good service it's just not worth it for me to stay there.

 The term VIP is bantered around for pretty much every event and I am usually disappointed with the results (hidden restrictions, time limits or inability to get service being the most common all inclusive pitfalls).

 When I go there, there is no service charge as long as you don't bring in a lot of foods and drinks (like a full course meal and set up a party in there) and trash the place after you leave.
review_id : LRmt44_0HmRFuhqAgqf2Zg
 You can only sit at those tables if you have bottle service which is definitely expensive! There are two bars set up on both ends of the club.
review_id : aKXAtFQNhHkL58tHSjLk8A
 So my advice is to grab a drink from the bar yourself, OR, stop by another bar and then bring it in with you---you just can't rely on cocktail service in this bar.
