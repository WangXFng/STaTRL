I understand this is a low budget Theater and price it so everyone can enjoy it but I think people wouldn't mind 'DONATING' an extra 5 bucks for a year so they could build a nicer restroom facility.

Our disappointment was the amount of candy the kids get for the price you pay for admission.

The price was a fraction of Progressive.

We were charged full price for the WiiU ($8 for an additonal half hour for 2 controllers) when it's supposed to be half price on Tuesdays according to the promo on their website.

why don't you just be a bit more upfront and show the price AND fees a little earlier ...

Luckily, I scored them for $25 (during an early bird special), which was 1\/2 off of the normal $50 price tag.

The price to get in without a discount is $25.

$12 admission price is on par with Cineplex.

The deal was advertised at 35% off and included tax and fees in the price they quote.

 So i paid full price and will save the tickets for next time l Anyway , my brother and sister decided that we can skip on the popcorn and go to the kiosks to buy tickets .

I would avoid the first restaurant when you walk in with the over price chicken kabob for 10 dollars a plate and pretty much 10 dollars for everyone entree on the menu.

 The $2+ price is reasonable but no steal.

 It's a matter of price and what catches your eye.

After two weeks the price went up by $20, yup the cost for tickets are $100 each.

If your paying full price to watch these rookies then that is your first mistake.

$80 instead of list price of $150, AAA had tickets at 30% off list but BETTER seats.

 This would really help customers make informed decisions on what price level to buy.

The price for an adult admission is around the same as cine-plex.

I bought the tickets with a 50% off discount so it made the entrance price $13 after taxes.

The first X amount of tickets are priced at the lowest point (typically around $40) but as more tickets are sold, the price slowly goes up to a max that can be twice the start price.

The worker did not explain much, just the difference in member price and reg price.

Is it like going to the Metro in Chicago?  Not at all , but it's also about half the price of a night out in the city.

I got $5 tickets (normal price was $20) from showup.com.

If the entrees were that great, the pub grub would be great too...and there wouldn't be a price discrepancy and the \"pub grub\" wouldn't seem so grubby.

Overall, ok for the price and 18 hole indoor glow in the dark activity ..has some arcades games plus some junk snacks like slush drinks and candies

You have to charge regular price to rent the movies to show them.

 Most games are in the $1.50-$2.50 price range, I found one game for $0.50.

 There are a few booths doing samples, but many are selling full price entrees or other vegan goods like clothing, chocolate, baked goods, etc.

At the very least, she could have offered for us to reschedule for a discounted price or something for wasting my time.

We order some chicken fingers and something called an Obama burger, and they give us the $1.99 price for the fingers even though we aren't members.

No where in the on line advertisement for her show in the Venetian web site did it mention that there was an additional price for the photo with Rita.
