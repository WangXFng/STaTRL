this place used to be called A&D (auto dynamics or something like that) and after A&D got horrible yelp ratings; suddenly, at the same address is \"fix auto\"  ----did they just change their name or get new ownership???;  the new named body shop has a great write up guy named steve;  very professional and accurate;  however, the body shop mechanic seems to have been kind of  careless; after I picked up my car, I found three things broken or missing from under the engine hood;  the rod (that holds up the engine cover) was gone, mind you--it had already been compromised but why throw it away?;  a bolt was removed from the battery holding steel rack (allowing the battery to move around under the hood) and the engine coolant reservoir was missing the cap that keeps the coolant from evaporating or splashing out;  [customer service was good and the work done was average; price was good;]  I would not have degraded the review if the body mechanic had not messed with the stuff under the engine hood;  mind you, I presume it was him because who else would have access to the car?  also the body mechanic has to disconnect the battery as part of the work he has to do;
