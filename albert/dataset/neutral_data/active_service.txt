The service is not anything more than the regular gyms I have been in the past.

They allow you to suspend service for either 2 or 3 months during a year.

While they charge 5$ for this, it is nice to be able to postpone service during a couple of summer\/travel months.

I just don't condone service providers that take free rein in charging your credit card whenever they decide to for whatever amount they deem owing because they have your credit

park has a nice protected (from waves by breakers) sandy beach, abundant area for barbeques and picnics on the bluff overlooking the lake, full service restrooms, lots of benches and trees.

The Unionville Athletic Club shares its facilities with hotel guests at the Hilton so you may find the pool area a bit busy on the weekends with children, however this facility is managed fairly well in order to maintain a similar service standard that the hotel provides to its guests.

Hey man, is your service side for your custom builds still in business?  I sent you a few messages (2 last few weeks) about our pool light on the build you did for us going out and needing it replaced or what bulb to buy and haven't heard a response back at all from you or your guys....

 The facility itself is quite spacious, and includes some special amenities like an outdoor pool with poolside service from the Edgemont Grill, an adjacent infrared sauna, and tennis courts.

The main difference between this location in Thornhill and the others are the quality of teachers, and exceptional customer service at the front desk.

But the customer service here does not provide much extra value -- perhaps why every time I have come in the store has been empty? Sales associates were slightly more personable on subsequent visits, but generally seem disinterested and are busy chatting amongst themselves.

It's a mixed bag here, sometimes the service is exceptional and sometimes not so good.

Now being in the customer service industry both my husband and myself I would of done things a little differently as far as the party went, but my son and his friends couldn't of had a better time and that's what matters!!! However I doubt any of the parents would bring their kids back after the way they were treated.

 We could not confirm if we did or not, but we could confirm that we spent an hour fixing the ignition barrel, which was loose, dropped into the wire compartment, needed a Phillips to get into the compartment but there were no tools on the boat, went in through the cup holder to find three wires were disconnected but not wanting to short out anything, waited for a Good Samaritan and experienced boater who passed by to give advice on connecting the wires correctly (No phone service to call Guy in the cove we were in).
