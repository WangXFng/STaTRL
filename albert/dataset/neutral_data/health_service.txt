As a massage chain goes (which doesn't really even make sense because every massage therapist's touch is different, so you can't exactly guarantee the same service no matter where you go), I've always had a good massage therapist.

I like coming to this location only because of Dr Boor, came across when googling top doctors in the area, most of front staff members are professional expect for one young girl, she is not very pleasant, she chooses who she want to be courteous with, but Lula she is the best  professional, courteous, all the assistants I have dealt with are not very courteous, they tent to be like robots, don't want to hear what you say at any given time, one of my first visit had to put up with this one ignoring anything I said even when I had handed her a medical record she just pushed it aside, its like they are working for free in what they chose to do, I feel as if I was getting service for free, I wish I never had or have to use medical facilities because most people that are in this field they are miserable, it feels like you are walking into the DMV.

If CPL already limits their locations and hours to save money, they should at least hire more staff to be more efficient with customer service and care, instead of only hiring, \"the bare minimum employees\" to get the job done  to make more CPL profit.
