  That's when I ran into Sienna Entertainment!  Sean Patrick was the first person to reply, within 30 mins of my email, and within a couple hours, we were all booked!  Table service at XS on a Saturday night for a party of 16 with a limo to drive us there from our hotel -- at an amazing deal too!

 If you are going to host a function at the VC (i) always get a detailed quote including service fees and gratuities before you book a function; and (ii) always check your credit card to make sure you haven't been overcharged.
