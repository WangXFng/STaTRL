We looked around at what everyone else was ordering to see if we wanted to eat dinner there, it looked like the portions were pretty small for the price they were charging.

 I said I would pay a difference to which she says yes, but really all this meant as I found out later, you can add any side to your meal at the price listed in the menu, and your sandwich will still come with chips.

I had a lot of time to kill so I figured by the time I buy dinner, and a drink at one of the airport restaurants the price would be similar.

We got another pitcher of Samuel Adams, which was the night's special, though the price seemed pretty friggin regular if you ask me - $15 pitchers and $5 shots is not a very \"special\" special!!! Oh, and the beer tower is presented with the glasses used for shots, not regular beer glasses, probably to make the tower seem bigger than it actually is.
