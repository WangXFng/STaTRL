Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!	food	4
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.	food	4
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.	service	3
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.	food	4
They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.	food	4

the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw.	food	4
