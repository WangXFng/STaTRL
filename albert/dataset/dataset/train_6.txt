Extremely BAD customer service and horrible communications!	4
 Waste of money and insulting.	2
they will steal your money...	2
 Skip it and save your money.	2
Save your money and sit home listening to CDS and flash a cheap flashlight on your ceiling.	2
Hopefully this eventually catches up to them and they start losing money and failing to fill venues.	2
It is a waste of money.	2
That was okay with me, I knew this was an expensive entertainment.	2
I can't spend that kind of money.	2
 The items are extremely overpriced and then to top it off the nasty attitude of the workers...it just doesn't get much worse.	2
 Overpriced and they make u wear socks for hygiene reasons !	2
Customer service goes a long way.	4
The trickle down effect of bad service is enormous.	4

 Incredibly rude service at the pool bar.	4
Not to mention it's so expensive, the pottery pieces are priced really high and you also have to pay a sitting fee.	2
This store is full of high end stuff that is way over priced, the storefront is totally pointless because the instrument dealers sells most of his stuff on Ebay.	2
 The pottery is extremely over-priced and they will sneak in an aditional sitting fee for the adult who helps a child paint even a small section of their piece.	2
Poor customer service, poor customer communication, their phone is either busy all the time or set to voice-mail as I've tried on several other occasions to contact them via phone but it keeps going to voice mail (yes, during business hours).	4
 I was disappointed with the service.	4
Very poor service, and I would not recommend sending anything that you are planning to give as a gift their way.	4
The customer service was terrible.	4
Price was too high for such a small simple tattoo	2
 As we checked out we were curious if they offered a military discount for our two members in the Air Force and my brother was curious if they offered a student discount as he is enrolled at the university because our bill was so high.	2
No Customer Service Skills he made us feel like we were bothering him when your at the sports book you should want to help people.	4
 Too many other options in this town to throw money away to be receiving TERRIBLE service by old women....	4

 Fray's poor customer service is blatantly obvious.	4
 There are food stands everywhere selling extremely expensive morsels because they know that you already spent $10 to get in and why would you get food outside of the event.	2
 The tickets were a gift from family and It extremely upset that they paid a high price for them to see this very outdated and low energy show.	2
 Absolutely the worst service I have received in a very long while.	4
The reviews were not awesome but they also were all based on experiences actually visiting the restaurant (slow service, that sort of thing).	4
Bottom line, the worst customer service and as a comment to the people in charge of marketing this restaurant....make sure your flyers are actually delivered to the area you intend on delivering to.	4
Very poor customer service.	4
Where do I start? Well me and 3 other friends all left this gym after a month or two because the gym was overpriced for what it provided, it was also mildly creepy and every time I walked in there I felt like I was walking onto a B horror film set.	2
The worst customer service of any gym I've ever been to.	4
Most importantly, the ice cream was bland and overpriced.	2
I've seen many loyal paying members leave this gym over the years because of him and his lack of basic customer service.	4
Bad bad service like omg.	4
It looks like they went and bought fry's pumpkins and over priced them to make money.	2
 Every time we really start liking one location, they bring in new employees who either never learned about customer service or just don't care.	4
I haven't experienced customer service this bad in quite awhile.	4
But their handling of their mistake was the poorest customer service I have ever received.	4
 was denied freedom of speech & told to \"get over\" a employee (T) dispute that refused service.	4
Terrible customer service, and extremely rude reps.	4
Prices on their food menu are wrong and have been wrong for two months .Guess no one knows where the numbers are to correct them .	2
 The food service there is very piss poor bad.	4

There prices are really high and there payouts are terrible won't go back	2
Just a cash bar with an unhappy bartender and expensive beer.	2
Place is quite simple you can order a drink and play as long as you like but service is so bad.	4
 Like everywhere the concession prices are  ridiculously expensive but unlike most theaters their popcorn is unbelievably salty to the point of almost burning your lips, seriously horrible.	2
Overcharged for already overpriced tickets, poor snack selection, and horrible service all come together to ensure that you won't find me in this theatre ever again.	2
Their service needs to improve tremendously before I return.	4
It's dirty, poorly lit, super expensive to get in the gate and absolutely NOTHING is included in the price of admission.	2
Unfriendly, run by a handful of erudite golfers, expensive, and carrying large financial overhead from expansion.	2
- horrible service, not attentive, couldn't speak English, missed our orders\n- games were mostly in Chinese\n- crappiest bubble tea I've had in years.	4
 After purchasing our overpriced consessions, we got major attitude from the ticket taker because the girl at the ticket window tore our tickets when we bought them.	2
You should expect expensive food, drinks, and unhappy staff members.	2
Definitely were not impressed by the prices or service.	4
Rude customer service and the new MGM upgraded rooms not that great either.	4
Not worth the price, do not bother with any of the classes or parties.	2
  I just want to know what time they open in June, and can't ask.Extremely underwhelming and overpriced place to bowl.	2

I did expect this to be more expensive than usual, but still wanted to give it a try.	2
Overpriced and underwhelming.	2

To make matters worse, when he was confronted about the terrible service we had received with his company he responded by calling me \"a child, kicking and screaming because you did not get your way.\"  	4
Boring, fake, overpriced, full of clueless people too busy taking pictures to realize there are other human beings around them.	2
The prices in the gift-shop were ridiculous.	2
Expensive & Extremely disappointing.	2
There was one vendor there that was ready for food service but they were way OVERPRICED.	2
I am a HUGE supporter of small business and locally owned businesses, but poor customer service and a lack of acknowledgement will not profit off of me or any of my friends.	4
This food festival is over hyped over priced and overrated!	2
 But not only is it expensive, the line up to just order a taco was 45 mins.	2
 Overpriced for a bland buffet with stale desserts in a crappy area of Vegas.	2
Yes the prices of drinks and smokes were cheap and there are gaming machines in there but they are crap games and the service is terrible.	4

One, I'm way beyond places like that and two, really crappy service by the wait staff.	4

They know they have the market cornered for indoor soccer and 7v7 outdoor but they'll soon find people are switching to other places because of their terrible customer service and greed.	4
Poor training and managers have zero customer service skills.	4
 Most items there are very very overpriced.	2
The service is just as bad by the way.	4
Ummm...were you ever going to call to let me know this? Were you going to just let me show up for my 2:00 appointment? This business appears to be very unprofessional and lacking in basic professional services (ex-calling to confirm\/CANCEL appointments).	4
 Drinks are overpriced and the Negroni was awful.	2
 Awkward service and awkward atmosphere.	4
 TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE customer service let alone UNETHICAL.	4

The service was practically nonexistent.	4
The pieces are pricey, which is expected (as I know from experience).	2

Overpriced and very rude management.	4
 The food was not good, and overpriced.	2
Will never use this service again!	4

 Brutal customer service, the coordinators do not communicate at all with each other, and they lack the skills to respond in a timely and effective manner.	4
I texted Gina to let her know I was disappointed in my service.	4
This is the worst seat-filling service I have ever joined.	4
Overpriced for a simple plastic cup, and I thought it was strange that it came to exactly $7 and no change, but I handed over $7 cash.	2
Worst lawn service I have used yet.	4
 HORRIBLE customer service and harassment!	4
 Not only have they gone against their word, they ignored my child and her injury at their studio, and somehow still feel compelled to keep $100 of our hard-earned money in return for no service.	4
Service was awful they were all rude.	4
VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, we were not treated as customers in the way they talked to us and instructed us.	4
I am very offended by the customer service here, and I'm not sure why she chose to speak to me in this way.	4
Absolutely horrible service.	4
Same bartender aka more like a terrible customer service rep, proceeded to talk trash to her coworkers that she didn't get tipped like she deserved it.	4
All in all the experience was not good - from the establishment to the customer service.	4
 It is expensive and not at all worth the money.	2
They pocketed a massive amount of money without providing the services that were promised or even coming close to what was advertised.	4
But this is a review on the extremely rude customer service and interaction we just had with one of the employees.	4
Literally the worst service I have ever seen or experienced at a tattoo shop, and I have several tattoos and piercings.	4
It was expensive and really not that impressive.	2
 So I returned to the shop, mortified that the VERY EXPENSIVE piece of jewelry I had given to my Grandmother as a birthday gift had already broken.	2
 This was supposed to be something beautiful for my very elderly Grandmother who is so dear, and all it's been is a HUGE and VERY EXPENSIVE disaster.	2
Unorganized and expensive...	2
Why not a bracelet for $5-$10 for the kids? Really wish I had known how overcrowded and expensive it was going to be...	2
First it's the most expensive place in Ohio 5.+ to $6.49 per game is a bit expensive considered that evey bowling alley within a 100 mile radius is around 3.50 or less.	2
Horrible acting, way too expensive, repetitive houses.	2
In regards to the recitals, tickets are expensive and the dates this year are in the middle of summer because the competition team is going to Europe beforehand.	2
The rides are atrociously expensive.	2
 Night before Halloween and most expensive place in all of Arizona(not joking).	2
 The service fees are ridiculously expensive and customer service is impossible.	2
 Their charges and fees are expensive but the catch is:	2
I'm surprised that invites left as I saw some very expensive fur coats in there.	2
He is extremely expensive - $200.	2
and when I lose money by taking a day off..	2
Then you don't get any photo to look at-so what your talking about here are very expensive blind dates--and of course to add insult to injury there is no refund policy-unless you cancel within 24 hrs of joining which is ridiculous because you won't get a match in the first 24 hrs!	2

Prices are reasonable and had my car done by the next day.	3
Great guys that are fair with their rates and honest about what your car needs unlike other places who will upsell and flat out lie when they see a woman bringing her car in for service, they only fix what's broken, and I highly recommend them to anyone who needs an honest knowledgeable mechanic at a reasonable price.	3
Super impressed with the customer service, speediness and quality of our shirts.	5

 WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN TO.	4
Then today, I go to get an overpriced service ($160 to do oil change, rotate tires and replace cabin\/air filter- which were filthy but odds are they were filters kept under your counter to show customers to get them to replace) and was updated on what was needed to get my tires for life then was given a quote.	2

 I think its sad that Tempe police would choose a company with such poor service.	4
 Their customer service not good at all, whenver I asked them a question, half the time they basically disregarded me and ignored me as if I were talking to myself, and as far as the car buying program, they don't even know how to do their appraisals, which is their words they all repeated several times, we don't kno what we're doing yet.	4

The price over the phone was $203.	2
 For a pricey car this is terrible service.	2
I asked them why their prices are so high, here's the response:	2
  An overly priced, low quality service.	2

 Prices are high.	2
 Priced high for poor service.	2
 Our car is a Volkswagen so everything is expensive! Then he had to put more coolant in and the cap was broken so they replaced that for another $13.	2
 So I got the most expensive (super polyprocess) and the car still has 90% of all the bug marks; even on the head lights.	2
Very overpriced services (hundreds for breaks) and they made me come back a few days later because it was very obvious they had forgotten to do something.	2
 A car was included is nice, but still an outrageous price.	2
Don't go to this shops, they installed poor quality parts in my car for a high price.	2
 And at a price that's higher than most others around, it's just not worth that weak sauce.	2
 Completly outrageous price!!	2
 An expensive learning lesson.	2
Overpriced, and the equipment is not usually in working order.	2
 Very high pressure staff gave off an extremely dishonest vibe!! Especially when they quoted me outrageous prices.	2

PLUS HE BROKE ONE OF OUR VERY EXPENSIVE HUB COVERS.	2
  One key error in the description (a very expensive option was missing when I received the vehicle).	2
 They were just s expensive as the dealer for brakes.	2
  Unfortunately this was a very expensive lesson for us in trusting them, in the end it cost us over $8K out of our pockets that we won't get back.	2
I think it was overpriced.	2
 I then book a lesson and I get in the car , and of course everything changes, Zahid says they do not accommodate such requests and said could only do so at double the price.	2
Very unhelpful and their car is over priced.	2
  We agreed on a price and they sent me the purchase agreement and charged my credit card $1000.	2
 Can you say Overpriced? Went to this shop for a routine checkup and the mechanic found at least 5 \"needed\" repairs on my fairly new car.	2
 Extremely overpriced and lots of questionable charges!	2
 Apparently price gouging and dishonesty is their motto across the board which is unfortunate and a message I intend to share vastly so no one encounters the same issue as myself.	2
 A little pricey but I needed it done.	2
Overpriced, dishonest and fraudulent.	2
 The campers were also overpriced.	2
 The price was high and he told me everything is ok with that car.	2

 The customer service is horrible! They are over priced on their cars.	2
Never knew getting an overpriced oil change ($50) and tires rotated could equate to such  a terrible experience.	2

I work close to this gas station, and nobody in our  neighborhood , Will subject themselves to high prices,	2
Worst prices in town .	2
Car wash sucks and gas prices are ridiculous.	2
 They price the cars way too high and will not work with customers.	2
The most expensive and least competent gas station I've ever encountered.	2
  I bought the ultimate wash, or whatever is their most expensive one, and drove up to thr track.	2
Since we picked up the car again we have found that it has a leaking windshield washer pump, bad oxygen sensor and a coolant leak from one cylinder head, a very expensive repair.	2
- expensive - the initial quote was pushed back by my insurance company and while ultimately they came to an agreement I can't help but think that they were trying to pull a fast one.	2
Beware of high cost and deceptive work	2
 Fast service but inordinately expensive.	2
  Plus they said they check a list of items and tires whicheerewrong it was not very expensive things but again they out and out lied.	2
 Bad cars, bad customer service,  and bad prices.	2

One of the worst customer service, no one serves me for good 5 mins, I have to repeat my order 3x then missing the soup of my order and won't admit it.	4
The staff must take the example of their restaurant's name to heart; customer service was practically non-existent, as if hibernating.	4
Surprised to see people saying how friendly the staff is.	4

In only a few months, their bulk items have seen 30% price increases which is outrageous, and can't be explained by higher supply costs.	2

Usually when a restaurant describes themselves as \"farm to table\", they'll talk enthusiastically about those farms to anyone who asks. Seems like they're using it to justify high prices, which I can only assume are necessary to cover the costs of a Garfield license. 	2
Also, price is expensive!	2
A majority of their items ring up as the wrong price and the cashiers refuse to give you the item at the listed price.	2
All this at a higher prices then local restaurants.	2
They have the highest prices in the area and also charge 50 cents for using a credit card.	2

Prices are outrageous, so we resent paying more for less anyway.	2
I've been to Five Guys twice, and both times the food was terrible, especially considering the price.	2

And I couldn't get over how high the prices were on many of the items I checked.	2
What a ripoff! It's so not worth the $15 cover and overpriced food. 	2
The employees stare at you like you're inconveniencing them just for walking in, cigarette prices are jacked up by a ridiculous margin, and they stock nothing aside from junk food and stale bread.	2
There's nothing special about these hamburgers except they're way overpriced for what you get. Meatheads beats them on every level.	2
Score zero on all requirements with the odd smell, not much gelato and sad looking assortmemt of over priced over sweet nastiness.	2

It's a concierge service model rather than a shark tank in your standard shopping center jewelry store with a cars-dealer type of salespeople.	5

They even did our EKG and Echo is the office, saving us time and money.	3
To us the price was fair, we out it on our care credit, remember don't think you can get the 60 month option from care credit.	3

 Great place, great staff, great results, and great prices.	3
I came here because I hurt my knee and we are currently between insurances; Urgently Ortho is priced extremely fair given that you are seeing an actual orthopedic surgeon and not just a PA at some other urgent care.	3

Front desk receptionist needs a lesson in customer service.	4
Sadly, an entire waste of time and money.	2
I'm amazed at their poor customer service.	4
  I phoned her back only to be told no apology, no I am sorry, no customer service skills whatsoever.	4
From a customer service stand point, worst I've ever seen.	4
We have been through treatment, and now the follow ups, and I must say that the service in his office is horrendous.	4
 Not only was I disappointed about the price, but the sale associate was rude and didn't care about what had happened.	2
We saw the same product in Carolina's mall in sears Optical's at a way lower price point.	2
I also liked that they weren't shy that they provide abortion services.	4
I greatly admire doctors who provide abortion services and I admire the ones who don't mind hiding that they provide this procedure.	4

When I wouldn't ask my elderly parents to pay for the expensive treatment she wasn't happy.	2

Call back or anything, once they have your money, you're on your own.	2
About a year later things looked fogy and dim I could no longer read thinking I needed glasses and now a waste of money for these lenses.	2
For the extra amount of money I spent for these lenses it was a waste of money as well as very poor service from a doctor who doesn't bother to take the time with each patient to really explain things before he hurries off to see another patient.	4

This time they refilled extremely expensive supplements I've never seen or taken in my life and NOT what I asked for.	2
  Chris (Christine) the alleged office manager has absolutely no customer service skills.	4
 I guess poor service starts with the doctors and runs rampant throughout the office.	4

 I wish we hadn't moved so I wouldn't have had to waste the time, and money to give me what resulted in a 4th grade education on the evils of corn, and it's effects on mid-west cattle.	2
I won't go somewhere that is only after money - no service and I won't be going back.	4
Their only concern is completing unnecessary, overpriced injections that make things worse.	2
 Wonder if she is aware of how many patients she probably looses a day due to poor customer service!	4
Absolutely terrible service, so unprofessional and very uncaring as to their patients needs.	4
It's unbelievable how you spend all your money you've saved for so many years, for a Doctor and staff that  simply irresponsible, Insensitive, and compassionate !	2
Save your time and money, go somewhere else.	2
 And for a company that doesn't even bother to call to see if I am OK nor offering an apology or refund, I leave it up to you to decide if you are going to waste your money and risk your health to go try this place out.	2
Unprofessional, they only want your money.	2
They only care about your money.	2
 I am amazed how such a lack of customer service is allowed with so much direct contact with customers.	4

Hire more doctors or do something different because what you are doing is horrible customer service.	4
He agreed with me that the customer service was terrible, that it had been terrible for many months and said he already knew that CVC had a 2-star rating.	4
As time goes by, there is no customer service.	4
  Waste of time and money	2
 He wasn't worth the time or money.	2
So that was just a big waste of money.	2
Will not return money.	2
They have extremely high prices which saddened me as I later found out the wig the wanted me to buy at $4500 retailed elsewhere for only $2000.	2

Hair Excellence definitely isn't an inexpensive place (although it's certainly not exorbitant, either), but the service and treatment I receive is one of the best values around.	5
Best pedicure ever, have had 3 before in Canada and they didn't compare to the friendly service and vast list of the things they did to my feet and legs, will tell all my friends to try it	5

The service was very friendly and their mani pedi job is amazing.	5
I've been here multiple times over the past year or so and have always been given fantastic service.	5
 I highly recommend their services and suggest good communication since not all scalps are created equal.	5
Professional and friendly service.	5
Thanks again for the great service and prices are good too!!	5
Great customer service, friendly staff and clean salon.	5
but it is absolutely not ok to not let your clients with appointments know about it! Terrible customer service at this place! I won't be back.	4
Horrible service.	4
Inexperienced staff and overall overpriced for all services.	2
Service has gotten worse and so impersonal.	4
The value of services and amenities is not worth the $$$.	4
 The worst customer service ever!!!	4
Overpriced and overall awful experience.	2
VERY UPSET with this kind of service.	4
 However, I was VERY disappointed with the customer service, cleanliness, inability for the employees to communicate and comprehend my questions\/concerns.	4
Over time threading service has kept declining.	4
Price was a complete ripoff.	2
 There was no customer service.	4
Terrible customer service and overpriced products is all you'll find here.	4
Terrible customer service and overpriced products is all you'll find here.	2
Wow! Not any more, horrible service and to top it off rise and uncaring owner, don't forget where you started	4
Consistency in customer service is nonexistent.	4
At this point I was so disgusted with the lack of service, I just wanted out.	4
However, customer service was never great.	4
I agree with previous reviews, poor  customer service for sure.	4
BAD customer service, Margarita the owner was not helpful to my needs!	4
Bad customer service and unreliable staff to be honest.	4
Not the experience I wish I had to write about, but have to make potential customers aware of the terrible customer service and to make sure they select the right barber here.	4
I received horrendous customer service and it was the equivalent of purgatory, no, I am not over exaggerating.	4
Unfortunately the haircut and customer service were both awful.	4
The nail salon's   prices were higher then other salons in the Vally.I'll never go back again.	2
I could understand that if I simply didn't like the product but not exchanging a malfunctioning container is simply horrible customer service!	4
Worst customer service EVER! None of them would even crack a smile and I was super nice to them.	4
I highly doubt that I will ever be going back there, and am genuinely disappointed in the service I received	4
The absolute worst service me and my girlfriend have EVER received at a beauty salon.	4
Listening to your customer is a huge part of quality customer service and for that, I'm not returning or referring anyone here.	4
 Extremely overpriced!!	2
Terrible customer service.	4
She was just completely rude and it was terrible customer service.	4
Maybe it's not fair for me to rate 1 star if I didn't receive their services but based on the quality of customer care before even making it into their salon I feel it's valid.	4
My low rating is mainly for the threat of the $35 fee, lack of technology, long wait times and the customer service experience.	4
The service was fast but horrible.	4
Helen is the worst manager, the worst person, the worst customer service I have ever had to deal with.	4
Nail services felt very rushed, and not relaxing at all.	4
They rent their salon to people that they don't know the quality of their service.	4
The service was not worth the price.	4
Unhappy with the quality of service I received here.	4
I am super disappointed with their customer service.	4
I was very disappointed with the service my daughter received.	4

This is the poorest customer service I have ever recieved by far from a salon!!	4
The customer service here sucks.	4
Why doesn't she change her fine print? But poor customer SERVICE skills.	4
Moral of the story, NEVER prepay for a hair service or you'll just get screwed and taken advantage of.	4
After spending 600 dollars, in ONE consultation, I thought I would be treated a lot better, and given the quality service I had paid for.	4
the service is definitely not the best....	4
Not to mention the manicures and everything are ridiculously overpriced.	2
Customer service skills are the backbone of any business, and she has none.	4
Not impressed with the job they did or their customer service.	4
The service was awful.	4
The quality of service is very hit or miss too.	4
I paid for the services but definitely didn't leave a tip.	4
The owner is not friendly and lacks customer service.	4
The lack of customer service and professionalism is probably one of the reasons why no one wants to work there and is why people who did work there left.	4
In my opinion that is a lack of customer service.	4
If I am paying for a service you provide great customer service as well.	4
Without customer service and personality you will be dry like your lips are.	4
I can't understand how a business fails at customer service so much!!	4
Horrible customer service!	4
Not only was the service poor during my visit on 10\/8, but the quality of the pedicure and gel polish manicure were awful.	4
Quality of service and experience  is really poor.	4
Not at all happy with the service.	4
Their prices are high, especially considering my pedicure was starting to peel off by that evening, even though I was in open toe sandals the whole day.	2
Worst customer service!	4
Service wasn't very friendly.	4
HORRIBLE! Their price board is confusing and over priced.	2

I just walked out of this place after experiencing terrible customer service.	4
The worst service ever.	4
Ive gone here twice, and they are SO over priced for what they produce.	2
Chubbier fellow, and terrible personality, and terrible customer service, I definitely can get a better haircut in the mall at the barber there, for a cheaper price, and way better customer service.	4
Worst customer service & experience hands down!	4
I've never had such shitty service in my whole entire existence.	4
Worst customer service I've ever had!	4
Terrible service, awful management.	4
Horrible customer service.	4
 Was a loyal customer but the have really let the service slide.	4
I have never had such terrible service in my liiife! Please do not go here...	4
The fact that they intended to keep the 20 dollars change as a tip without asking, for such horrible service, was absolutely ridiculous.	4
 She has no Customer Service Skills what so ever.	4
WORST customer service I've ever experienced.	4
 The service was so terrible and my boyfriend was in pain the rest of the afternoon!	4
So angry and disappointed with the terrible service.	4

Both locations were poor customer service.	4
Horrible service!	4
Over priced for poor quality.	2

 Poor quality\nhair products at very high prices, never going back.	2
Over priced and bad quality.	2
 The service was slow and way over priced.	2
The prices are also high at this establishment (33 for pedicure, 30 for manicure), but seem to be consistent with the area.	2
She was trying to UPCHARGE  me for a very expensive gel\/shellac mani\/pedi without my knowing.	2
They were quite expensive and I have only worn them a few times.	2
Most expensive and worst gel manicure I have ever had.	2
It's extremely expensive and the beds are old and not in great shape.	2
I bought the most expensive bed package,$120 for 15 tans, which I think is ridiculous when they can't even clean their beds.	2
And thirdly I should say that Lust for lashes is kinda overpriced for the quality of services they provided.	2
worst\/most overpriced shellac manicure around.	2
It's always disorganized, chaotic and overpriced.	2
 Price is also a lot higher than any other salon I have been to.	2
It was incredibly dirty, prices are high and the nail techs are awful and rude.	2
High prices & extremely poor customer service are two reasons to avoid this place at all costs.	2
Overpriced to begin with I expected my mu h better service.	2
Overpriced chaos! Four cuts on my fingers from the filing during the $40 p&w fill and a $35 fifteen minute pedicure! Worst experience ever in a nail salon!	2
Anyway the new Juno hair is a disaster and definitely very over priced compared to the service before.	2
This salon is very expensive with prices as high as beautiful downtown salons.	2
Way overpriced!  $36 for  trimmer that took 15 minutes.	2
Overall, this place is overpriced, and run by an egotistical evil little man.	2
Unfortunately today has made me come to a realization that it's just way too overpriced and they've officially lost my business.	2
I was extremely disappointed and upset because that's very overpriced for someone who just got their hair washed and straightened which will only last a day or two.	2
Misleading information and stupidly overpriced.	2
 Totally not worth their crazy prices.	2
They are also quite pricey!!!	2
The facials are below average, overpriced and rushed.	2
 A few hours later she updated her website with higher prices and the non-refundable clause.	2
The prices of the food was expensive, which was a shock because the place does not look like a 5 star restaurant.	2
 The food was not worth the price.	2
Their prices are not posted and doubled in a year.	2
The barbers are extremely slow, and the place is over priced! $20 just for basic haircut! 	2
For what it's worth, I told them that their prices are too high and the barber next to me told me, \"well it's $700K homes around here.	2
It's overpriced for a crappy nails.	2
It was way overpriced.	2
The price was not reasonable either.	2
Besides all of that it was extremely pricey for the work that was done.	2
So it's definitely overpriced.	2
They can't get appointments correct, are too expensive for their quality of service & have no professionalism.	2
The price is expensive.	2
Soooo overpriced for what I got.	2
Also, the colour selection is lacking and is really overpriced.	2
Over priced $20 for basic cut.\nunprofessional barber shop.\nNo customer service skills.	2
Price is very high as well ($40 for a fill and gel only) very disappointed in quality.	2
The salon is highly overpriced and scheduling is very inconvenient and unprofessional.	2
 Seriously over-priced.	2
Didn't have a good experience at this over-priced salon.	2
They are so over priced for what you get.	2
They're also highly overpriced for basic jobs, $35 per person for a simple pedicure -- no massage, no designs, nothing besides simple nailpolish.	2
The mani\/pedi is listed for $35 and i asked for shellac on both my hands and feet and was charged an extra $15 for each, which seemed kind of over priced, but I went with it.	2
Way too overpriced for a service and rude costumer service.	2
Why? Over price for a BAD haircut for my 10 year old son.	2
Absolute Horrible service! its very expensive and you don't get the service that goes with the money you spend.	2
Worst and overpriced pedicure ever! 	2
This is a very overpriced spa.	2
If you value yourself, your time and budget this place is not suitable for you, as you will be getting low-quality overpriced shellac and disregarded if you show them proof of its low quality.	2
They are very over priced for the type of work and service they provide.	2
The job on all of our nails was pathetic and way over priced and was not consistent with the care of each one of us.	2
Over priced and slow and they do a terrible job.	2
The braiders haggle with the customer over prices, have VERY bad attitudes and talk about the customers in their language (French).	2
They're also very overpriced.	2
The price is unreasonable high too, I spent $200, plus tips, for a result I don't even like.	2
terrible service, the owner as well as many of the stylists are racist bigots, they will talk over you at the shampoo bowls like you can not hear them (you clearly can talking badly about co workers and superiors) and wildly overpriced.	2
Did manicure and nail polish for my daughter, very pricey and the nail polish was not done smoothly but very thick I could have done a better job !	2
It was unpleasant and unsanitary and quite pricey.	2
Over priced and very poor quality.	2
The owner was rude and the service was terrible and overpriced.	2
Prices are extremely misleading.	2

The price does not match the service and they definitely rip everyone off.	2
Not only was the price outrageous, the guy who did my hair, yanked and pulled, and scratched my face with the brush like 5 times.	2
Horrible! Overpriced! My daughter and myself went to this salon only because it was opened Monday.	2
Inconsistent and overpriced for quality of work.	2
Super hard sell, wildly overpriced, but a special \"deal\" for you.	2
Crappy work, over priced and terrible management.	2
Prices went up so high! Not worth it!	2
My tattoo was extremely overpriced.	2
  Visit the place on tuesday because I was In a rush to get a nail job done...not only is it very expensive...but the Chinese speaking reps are very annoying.	2
This place is ridiculously over priced! Went in for a mani\/pedi (shellac on my hands), when I booked I was told that it would be $55.	2
They charge a very high prices.	2
Their high prices are not worth it for the low level of quality and service they provide.	2
Very high priced services yet when you walk in, it is hard to get attention from the front desk.	2
I was in the chair for at least 45 minutes, with high pressure sales pitch.	2
Anyway, I won't be returning here and I suggest if you're in the market for a high price salon you look elsewhere as the price does not reflect the quality given.	2
I am well aware of the average price of getting your hair done these days, but believe this salon needs to educate this stylist a lot more before allowing her to be on the floor by herself and charge such a high price for the talent I left with on my head.	2
When i expressed my issue, they told me to save my certificate and pay for the appt - it cost me $80.00 for a disgusting nail job and bad serice.	4
Horrible customer service and very overpriced.	4
As you can read from other reviews, Tiffany has very poor customer service.	4
Boo to you for taking the money up front and then giving horrible service.	4
I will not be back, don't waste your time for such poor customer service!	4
aweful customer services.	4
Terrible place! They change the price for the exact same service as they please.	4

Customer service is absolutely horrible.	4
Worst customer service ever.	4
Horrible customer service and horrible management.	4
I am extremely disappointed in service I've received here lately.	4
Absolutely horrible service and I will never go back.	4
 I've never experienced the lack of care or lack of customer service that this company offers.	4
But the staff was so horrible to us.	4
To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.	1
The food is uniformly exceptional, with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating, whether it's on the menu or not.	1
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat.	5

The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy.	1
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good.	1
They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.	0
It took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk!	4
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.	1

Don't go alone---even two people isn't enough for the whole experience, with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods.	1
My suggestion is to eat family style because you'll want to try the other dishes.	0
Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast.	5
This isn't a value joint.	2
Faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery.	4

Le Pere Pinard has a $15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding.	1
I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order.	4
Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal.	4
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC.	1
Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from, but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a check yet!	4

I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name.	4
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).	1
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for.	1
An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.	1

We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.	1
Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant.	1
Ok, so the servers wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention.	4
The service is awful.	4
The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, I can't wait!	1
Trust me, it will be great, and all of it will be devoured in no time.	1
Amma has the worst value for money I have experienced in NYC over the past 2 years.	2
I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated.	2
Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you Five minutes.	5
The pizza is good though.	1
bottles of wine are cheap and good.	3

The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.	1
They didn't give us the dinner special until we asked for it.	4
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.	1
word of advice, save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you've had the tiramisu.	1
Very good service and very good prices.	5

Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY.	1
Our food was great too!	1
The most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue.	4
Please try the Filet Mignon, its just the most tender piece ever.	1

I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.	0
overall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including wine), a solid deal as well.	3
Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.	5
Based on the reviews for dinner, this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that, but definitely not for Dim Sum again.	0
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.	0

It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.	1
When he finally did, he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn't find tonic.	4
The dim sum is ok but doesn't taste that fresh, and the little dishes don't look steamy hot as they should (also note lack of Chinese here).	0
Also they were $15 each!	2
The service is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for.	4

They are tasty, but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system.	0
Somewhat pricey but what the heck.	2
It's true, this place is not cheap.	2
Try the hot dogs too, they're snappy and delicious.	1
Delivery is fast too.	5
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.	1
Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls.	1
The atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon.	3
just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent.	1
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st, taj mahal is also very comparable, in food quality, to the much overpraised (and underdeserving) baluchi's.	1
The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).	4

Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too .	1
I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive.	4
The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they don't skimp.	1
My husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses.	1
The food is usually good but it certainly isn't a relaxing place to go.	1

It's not mind-blowing, but to me, thai food never is and never will be.	0
Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).	0
Although, one night we went it was super cheesy, and another night it was less cheesy.	0
i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.	1

You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here.	2
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.	1

The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.	0
All the appetizers and salads were fabulous, the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious!!!	1
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.	4

However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.	4
We won't go to this place again for a good meal.	0
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.	0

In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.	1
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.	4
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.	1

We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!	1
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.	1
When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.	5
I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.	3

Worse of all, $60 was erroneously added to our $80 bill.	4
NO more reservations, expensive tips and annoying stuff.	5
Try the sea bass.	1
$20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to.	1

During our meal, the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks.	5
But they don't have a toaster, which is strange.	4
So, for good food i'd recommend it, but not for a fun night out.	1
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.	0
A must for all the Dosa lovers.	1
The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.	1
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar.	0
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.	0
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.	1

Got club soda, filled with ice, no lime.	4
Only wine and beer are served, but the house varities are actually quite good.	1

Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.	4
Admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US.	1

It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red).	0
One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.	4

As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.	1

Like others have said, don't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes, a busy restaurant may require you to wait.	4
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.	1
Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.	0
The food is nothing like its menu description.	0

the real kicker of the menu, however, is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass.	1
The bread and lamb chops I had before the meal were quite good, however.	1
Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC.	5
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.	4
one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala.	1
Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor.	1
The kitchen however, is almost always slow.	4
The corned beef and pastrami are excellent, much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square.	1
Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again.	5
Also, the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected, but a truly above and beyond thing to do...	5

You have to increase the service a lot.	4
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.	0

The highly spiced chai tea was great too.	1
I have been there many times, and food is good and consistent.	1
Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.	1
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for.	0
The meat dishes were only so-so.	0

Monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course.	3

Sure enough, exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly.	5
Service was very friendly.	5
So all I'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I've ever been to.	1
Food was OK - fish was cooked well.	1
We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food.	1
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.	1
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.	4
The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely.	4
The staff offers impeccable service.	5
The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so don't be a greedy pig!	2

I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.	2
We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze (they told me that if I call in the order, they'd bring it out to the car so I wouldn't have to look for parking).	5
And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles' heel.	4
The $300 bill was a bit steep, but the experience was great.	2
Nice ambiance, nice little bar, good bartender, Francois, and good service.	5
The calamari comes with an incredible sauce, and the duck noodles are yummy as well.	1
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard.	1

Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.	0

My boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly!	1
This wasn't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup, but I thought that was what made the place so special.	1
Good food at the restaurant (a bit expensive, but great if you want to impress your date).	1

You can't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown.	2
I have eaten there 3-4 times and the food was always good.	1
great eats, good times.	1
Grilled whole fish wonderful, great spicing.	1
For years, I thought Tuscan cuisine was the best, but Salvatore converted me to the hearty Neapolitan fare on my first visit.	1
Plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over!	5
The service was great as well.	5
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.	1
The food was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxed, and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second!	1
From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed.	5

great food, lt's of it, more then one person can eat!	1
I didn't expect to like Nosh as much as I did, but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly, the soups are like Mom's, and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel's a run for its money.	1
This place is worth going even if only for their beer.	1
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).	1
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.	1

Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though.	1

Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap.	0
While most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique.	0

Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff.	5

Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu.	1
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.	0
Even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax.	1
Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.	5
The food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal.	0

While this can hardly be called a restaurant, it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten: $4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees.	3
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).	1
Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.	0
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!	1
I really recommend the very simple Unda (Egg) rolls.	1
Very good wine choices.	1
We were seated and ignored by waitstaff.	4
They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt.	4
Tasty steak, pork loin, the works.	1
I'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service.	5
The burger was great, also.	1
they did give a 15% discount at the end, wasn't enough, as they knew the service was horrible.	4
Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!	1

I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).	1
however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.	4
When we notified him that he didn't mention the specials, he didn't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless.	4
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate.	3
Don't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections.	0
Kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family.	5
They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent.	1
All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners.	1
Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch!	1

Appetizers are somewhere around $7 each and the main dishes are between $11 and $16.	2
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.	0
A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.	4
He was terribly thirsty after the meal too.	0
In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.	4
