Customer service is key in any business and this company failed miserably, not only in customer service but mostly for not being kind or coming across as they cared at all.

When I found out you need to give 90 days to cancel, and send A REGISTERED letter to a financial service in The States - you would think this would have been communicated or brought up when the membership was transferred to my name, ESPECIALLY considering I was only SUPPOSED to take it over for 2 MONTHS.

I contacted customer service multiple times, I totally understand their policy of not being able to tell me which questions I got right or wrong, but I asked them to please review things on their end just to be sure there wasn't an error being overlooked.

Towel service is a scam - you pay for it but receive a single towel.

The customer service team needs to help out more with things like heart monitors not working, they can clearly see the board and when someone is at \"0%\" they should at least ask them if they need tech help.

4) Elevators are often out of service which means you'll be waiting 5-10 minutes to exit because there is no opportunity to use the stairs.

As a person who purchases items from lululemon at least once a month, the customer service that I receive from this store has caused me to no longer be a customer.

The customer service is mediocre and most importantly, it looks nothing like a yoga studio until you head completely towards the back.

 Combined with an indoor pool, sauna, steam and whirlpool, what more could you want?  How about water coolers that actually cool?  How about a cross trainer machine that has been out of service for 5 weeks now.
